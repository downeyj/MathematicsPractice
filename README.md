#MathematicsPractice.org

MathematicsPractice.org is a free web app for children to practice math.  

I'm starting with basic arithmetic and will add additional topics over time.

At the moment, it is completely based on client-side JavaScript with no server-side code. It uses JQuery, Underscore.js, and the Bootstrap css framework.

Feel free to make suggestions or volunteer to help out. You can reach me at downeyj at gmail.com.
